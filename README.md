This application is built on a modern web development stack designed for speed and scalability.

Here are the core technologies:

Frontend:

React: For building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For highly customizable and utility-first styling.
shadcn/ui: A collection of accessible and customizable UI components built with Tailwind CSS.
Lucide React: For icons.
Various other libraries for specific functionalities like charting (recharts), rich text editing (react-quill), form management (react-hook-form), routing (react-router-dom), and animation (framer-motion).
Backend & Infrastructure: The backend services, including data storage (entities), user authentication, real-time communication, and integrations with external services (like AI models), are all powered by the base44 platform. This allows me to focus on building the features you see, rather than managing the underlying server infrastructure.
